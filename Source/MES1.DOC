#00000
It's time to say goodbye. Thank you for everything,
even though I'm a little embarrassed. Cecilia will miss
you, come visit once in a while.$
#00001
Tell Bermuda not to die out there. If things get
dangerous, he should run this way.$
#00002
I'm so worried about Bermuda, my heart is racing. Come
on, touch it. Can you feel it?.. Huh? It's soft?..
What are you touching, you idiot?$
#00003
What happened? You seem awfully quiet. What? The Hydra
roared? Is that true? And Bermuda is still in the Temple
of the Sun?$
#00004
No! I don't want Bermuda to die! Triton, you're a hero,
aren't you? Do something!$
#00005
I don't like Trollovich. I don't like weak guys. A guy
must be strong, like Triton or Bermuda.$
#00006
I don't know if Bermuda is a good guy... I just held his
hand, and he turned red... Oh no, why am I turning red
too?$
#00007
Triton, what do you think of Bermuda? I don't mean
whether you like him or not, but as a human being.$
#00008
What? What do I think?.. I don't think it will grow
into something serious.$
#00009
Triton, you're such a perv.$
#00010
I can't take it any more, my heart is beating so fast!
I feel like I'm going to die... Hey! Are you trying to
touch me again, you pervert?$
#00011
Triton! What should I do? I don't want to go on a date!
What if he starts acting pervy?$
#00012
What if he kisses me by accident?.. Ew, no! Triton, do
something! I'm so nervous, my heart is about to burst!
Here, feel it!$
#00013
Eeek! Where are you touching me, you lecher?$
#00014
Triton, are you up to the task?$
#00015
You may want to watch out for Lucia.$
#00016
I think you've grown a little more manly. You looked
a little meek when we first met.$
#00017
You didn't find Metis all that scary? Neither do I,
but my grandpa, he's terrified of her.$
#00018
The puzzle in the Temple of the Titans? Did Emeralia
tell you to think on your feet? Well, it doesn't mean
you have to use your toes...$
#00019
Sorry, I've no idea. I usually go there with Cecilia.$
#00020
Hey, Triton, how are you? Did you go to the Temple of
the Titans? Isn't it beautiful there? But that place
has a sad history.$
#00021
The goddess statues were built to honour the courage of
the Titans who died fighting the Hydra, back when Kronos
and Rhea were still around.$
#00022
Those statues are magnificent, but none of the Titans
will ever see it. They all died because of Medusa.$
#00023
The reason Lady Metis created that puzzle was probably
so she could be alone with her memories of the Titans.$
#00024
Which apple did you drop, the silver or the iron one?..
Heavens, what am I doing? I think I've picked up some of
grandpa's habits.$
#00025
That's the sword of Artemis, isn't it? It's imbued with
the power of Pleasure. Not sure if that's any good, but
she says it's a power none the less.$
#00026
Well, I'm sure it's a good thing... You're going to the
Temple of the Sun, aren't you? Be sure to take the iron
apple with you.$
#00027
You can't just keep the crest. Draw the sword!$
#00028
You need to get the crest and draw the sword.$
#00029
So that was the sword of Lady Artemis after all. What
should I do? If I don't do something, the Hydra will
come back. It's a horrible monster!$
#00030
It's a monster of destruction created by Medusa. If
the Hydra awakens, not only this galaxy, but the entire
universe will cease to exist.$
#00031
That's what my grandpa said. And he has seen the Hydra.$
#00032
A sword? I don't think he said anything about swords.$
#00033
Have you met Lady Artemis?.. I should get some cognac
pizza sometime. It's delicious.$
#00034
Did Bermuda tell you the solution? What was it?.. Oh,
it was that simple? Even Artemis could solve it.$
#00035
Truth is, the puzzle used to be so elaborate that Lady
Artemis couldn't figure it out. She used to wake me up
every time she went out at night.$
#00036
Whenever I came to her, she always had something to say.$
#00037
I've got to admit, I'm starting to like you. Go talk to
Bermuda.$
#00038
Would I go if Cecilia came along? No, not even then...
Uh? You don't have to stick around for hours? And do you
have to stay until the end?$
#00039
I see!.. Triton, it's wonderful! We'll talk for a little
while and then say goodbye. If that's the idea, then
I'm fine with it.$
#00040
I'm not going anywhere. Go talk to Fati.$
#00041
Me, go on a date with Bermuda? Pah! I'd rather go with
Narcissus than that guy... Beg me all you want. If you
want a date, just ask Fati.$
#00042
Yes! Fati and Bermuda should go on a date. Talk to her.
It's about time she got interested in men, not flowers.$
#00043
The Sphinx trap has been in the works for a while, but
Bermuda changed it the day before Medusa attacked...
I shouldn't have slapped him.$
#00044
Did you fall for the Sphinx trap too? So did I. I'd like
to see Lady Artemis, but I just can't get through.$
#00045
There's a stone slab not too far off, but I don't know
what it means. I think you're supposed to push a button,
but Bermuda won't tell me.$
#00046
And don't put your hand on my shoulder like that. It's
not like we're dating or something.$
#00047
It's your first time in the Temple of the Moon, right?
Take your time, enjoy the scenery.$
#00048
Where are you from? My name is Druia. I was surprised
when the Sea and the Sun suddenly disappeared. Is it
true that Medusa came for revenge?$
#00049
What? You are Poseidon's son? No way, you don't look
like him at all. You're quiet and you haven't even grown
a beard. But your eyes... $
#00050
No, the eyes don't look like him either. Are you good
with alcohol? No? You look less and less like Poseidon.
How is Cecilia?$
#00051
That's good to hear. I was a bit worried about Cecilia.$
#00052
How about you take Druia with you? I can convince her.
I think you two would be perfect for each other.$
#00053
I'm too young to die!$
#00054
Goodness, the Hydra is about to awaken! But I've so
much yet to see! And what of my retirement harem?..$
#00055
Don't look too deep into yourself... Say, Triton, how
do you like Druia? She may not look like it, but she's
actually nice and feminine.$
#00056
How about you take her back to your planet?$
#00057
Have you met Trollovich? I think Druia's rejected him.
Well, that's hardly surprising. Druia needs a good man,
just like you.$
#00058
What? Cursed blood? Sorry, I'm drawing a blank here.
Can't tell you about something I don't know.$
#00059
What do you think of Bermuda? I never really liked him,
but Druia seems to be into him... But she didn't have
to date him.$
#00060
Triton, your persistence will be the death of me. Here,
have the bloody sapphire.$
#00061
I was going to give it to my granddaughter as a wedding
present, but you seem to need it more.$
#00062
Damn, you're persistent... I'm going to call you
Drytone from now on.$
#00063
I used to be a surfer when I was young. Very popular
with gals, too. The sapphire-blue sea would always be
full of birds chasing me.$
#00064
What? Sapphires? Never heard of those... Don't fall for
these silly rumours.$
#00065
Lady Aphrodite truly is the goddess of Beauty. You
should see her in a swimsuit, that body is just...
Perfection!$
#00066
Don't lose your head over Lady Aphrodite's body. That
body the best in the galaxy.$
#00067
Have you met Lady Aphrodite? She is... oh my. $
#00068
I used to go on dates at the Temple of the Titans. Full
moon, just the two of us on a boat, alone... Romantic,
isn't it? Best way to a gal's heart.$
#00069
You've got the sword of Lady Metis? I'm surprised she
trusted you with it... Me and her, we're not on very
good terms. Don't ask me why.$
#00070
Did you meet Lady Metis? Did she say anything about me?
No? That's all right.$
#00071
Why don't you ask Lady Artemis? As pointless as it is,
heh.$
#00072
Look who's here! It's Drytoe!.. Just kidding, heh-heh.
I envy you, you get to go to so many places.$
#00073
You've come to ask me about something? That puzzle in
the Temple of the Titans? Don't bother. Go ask a woman,
the one who's in love with you.$
#00074
Women can't resist the men they love.$
#00075
Don't bite an apple just because it's an apple.
Especially when it's made of iron! Heh, it's like
biting into Lady Aphrodite.$
#00076
Whoa! That's the very sword of Lady Artemis! You did
it, baby! No one puts you in a corner, eh?.. Oh, that
gives me hope!$
#00077
You're going back to the Temple of the Sun, aren't you?
Be sure to take the iron apple with you.$
#00078
Hurry up and use the crest of Lady Artemis to draw her
sword!$
#00079
Triton, you need to get the crest from Lady Artemis.$
#00080
Indeed, I have seen the Hydra. It's a giant immortal
water serpent created by Medusa. With nine heads that
grow back when they're cut off.$
#00081
And it's blood is so venomous that anyone would go mad
and die from just a single drop... But that is not the
true horror of the Hydra.$
#00082
The Hydra is a monster of destruction. When it awakens,
everything will be gone. Not only our galaxy, but the
entire universe.$
#00083
If you don't get the crest from Lady Artemis soon,
the world will cease to exist.$
#00084
The Hydra will awaken... and terrible things will
befall us all. The end of the world is coming, as
foretold a long time ago.$
#00085
'When the rich Aegean Sea falls into heaven,
The Sea of Life will turn into drops of death
And turn all life to stone.$
#00086
All light will be extinguished,
And the universe will be shrouded in darkness
Until the drops of the Seas of heaven and earth fall.'$
#00087
A-ah!.. I'm in panic! When the Hydra awakens, it will
be the end of the world!$
#00088
A gloomy face darkens one's soul. What happened,
Triton? You couldn't pull out the sword? What sword?..
Oh, the sword of Lady Artemis?$
#00089
Goodness, something terrible is about to happen! The
Hydra is waking up!$
#00090
Did Lady Artemis offer you a cognac pizza? Don't fall
for it. Bermuda nearly died from that stuff.$
#00091
Do you like fishing? I absolutely love it. Especially
catching nice fit gals on the beach...$
#00092
Do you have a girlfriend?.. Oh. A friend, then?..
Ptolemy? That's a silly name. One that you'd attach
to a false theory or something.$
#00093
You should fall in love. It makes you feel alive. Why
not steal the heart of a goddess? Heh-heh.$
#00094
Bermuda must know the mechanics of the Sphinx trap.
He's the one who set up everything here, after all.
I just don't like him.$
#00095
Have you met Druia? Isn't she a beauty? She's actually
my granddaughter. So keep your hands to yourself.$
#00096
Heh-heh, seems like the Sphinx statues have thrown you
out too. Druia complains about those every day. They
were once pets of the Titans.$
#00097
The Hydra wiped them all out, and all that remains now
are stone statues like those two.$
#00098
By the way, Triton, have you seen Lady Artemis? She is
the goddess of the Moon and someone that you will never
forget once you meet her.$
#00099
Oh, you must be Drytoe, the son of Poseidon, patron god
of the Sea... Heh, just kidding, Triton. You look good.$
#00100
My name is Worme. Surely you've heard of me? The most
famous playboy in the galaxy. I've had more women than
I can count, and made cry even more.$
#00101
There were a few women who left their marks on me, of
course... Goddesses, even! I'm telling you, I was the
talk of the universe!$
#00102
Eh? You don't believe me? I'm still popular, you know!
With gals of a more... refined age. By the way, have
you met Druia yet?$
#00106
So? How do you like it?$
#00107
Well, suit yourself. $
#00108
Here I come! A striptease from your lovely Artemis!$
#00109
Triton, you did it! You've collected four swords! To
celebrate, your lovely Artemis will give you a peek of
her skin. A small striptease!$
#00110
Oh... I'm so embarrassed to be naked. But I did it in
the heat of the moment!$
#00111
I knew about Medusa. Poseidon's father used to complain
about her to me when he got drunk. But I don't really
care either way.$
#00112
I know it's disheartening. But Medusa is Medusa, and
you are yourself. Let's cheer you up! Eat some cognac
pizza until you can't stand up!$
#00113
I made it myself. It's delicious, isn't it? Did it
cheer you up?.. Well, I'll do it with my own bare hands
then!$
#00114
Here I come! A striptease from your lovely Artemis!$
#00115
What's wrong, Triton? Your face will get mouldy from
being sour like that. If something's bothering you,
leave it to Artemis!$
#00116
Hold on, just a little longer. I'm sure I'll remember.$
#00117
Cursed blood? I think I've heard that one before...
Hold on... Feels like it's about to come up, but it
doesn't. Like I'm constipated!$
#00118
Goodness, I'm so vulgar! Tee-hee!$
#00119
Hey, are sapphires tasty?$
#00120
Sapphires? Are they edible?$
#00121
I, Artemis won't stand for this! How dare anyone stand
in your way? How dare anyone waste your precious time?!$
#00122
... So how about a nice relaxing cup of tea? A little
bit of tea never hurt anyone.$
#00123
Aphrodite is so mean, playing all these dirty tricks. A
pure-hearted maiden like me would never do that to you!$
#00124
I did have a hand in designing that Sphinx trap, too...
Ha-ha, that happens sometimes. It's not like goddesses
grow on trees, you know.$
#00125
Isn't Aphrodite beautiful? Pity she gets fat so easily.$
#00126
No, you can't use my sword.$
#00127
Oh! That's the sword of Metis, the sword of Courage!
Neat! Show me how you cut up a cognac pizza with it!$
#00128
Was Metis, mad at me? I took her olives the other day
without telling her.$
#00129
A brilliant solution, if I do say so myself. As
expected of Artemis, goddess of the Moon!$
#00130
Oh, you're not Ding-dong, you're Triton... Heh-heh.
What do you want with me, goddess of the Moon?$
#00131
Oh, I see. Why don't you just swim across the moat?..
Huh? You can't swim? Then why not just learn to swim?$
#00132
Goodness, who is that?.. Wait, it's Triton! Long time
no see! So wasn't Metis a beauty?.. What? You haven't
met her yet? What a bore.$
#00133
What is it? Oh, I see. So you want to be with me, this
beautiful woman, this goddess, after all? That's going
to be... a no. Ha-ha-ha!$
#00134
Oh, right. Find the iron apple and go to the Temple of
the Titans. There you will meet the Titanid Metis.$
#00135
Metis is very beautiful. Although I'm even more
beautiful than her. Ha-ha!$
#00136
Hey, Triton. What's wrong? Where's the sword?.. Huh?
A crest? Oh no. How could Artemis, goddess of the Moon,
forget about that?$
#00137
What's a crest, again?.. Oh, ha-ha-ha! Don't make such
a face. Here, this is the crest of Artemis.$
#00138
Sorry to keep you waiting, sir. Here you go. That
will be 98 million gold, tax included.$
#00139
Are you angry with me, Triton?.. No? Good. I'm a little
worried about you.$
#00140
Every day, I wake up and start worrying about what I'm
going to do if the universe disappears and I can't eat
cognac pizza any more.$
#00141
I haven't seen old Worme lately. How is he doing? Tell
him to bring me some fish once in a while if he catches
something. I'm starving.$
#00142
Today in Galaxy Teleshopping we're introducing this
sword of a goddess. It comes with a leather scabbard
and is priced at just 10,000 gold.$
#00143
The scabbard is cross-stitched, so it is sturdy and
resistant to fraying. If you buy 10 right now, you will
receive a dagger signed by Artemis!$
#00144
There is a limited number of daggers available, so
call in and don't miss out!$
#00145
Oh, I've seen your face before. Wait, let me guess...
Er, who are you, again?$
#00146
Oh, I know! You're Triton, right? You don't look like
Poseidon at all. How come you don't have a beard?.. Oh.
How would a child grow a beard? Ha-ha!$
#00147
So what brings you here? Ah, I get it. You must be
hungry, right? Do you want some cognac pizza?.. No?$
#00148
I see. So, if you're not hungry, are you here... to
propose to me, by any chance? Ah, of course. I am
beautiful, after all.$
#00149
But even if we're getting married right away... What?
No? What sword? Well, I wasn't going to marry you
anyway. I knew that all along.$
#00150
I am the goddess of the Moon, after all!.. Heh-heh.
Artemis, goddess of the Moon!.. Yeah...$
#00151
Ahem. So you want the sword of the goddess, eh?..
They're near the Sphinx somewhere, grab yourself
