#00000Triton... Triton... Wake up. Can you hear my voice?$#00001Wake up... Break through the boy's cocoon.Open yourself up to the bountiful celestial winds.$#00002Even if you are about to fall, do not lean on anyone.Stand firm, eyes wide open, and look up to the sky.$#00003Triton... Triton... Can you see it? I know you cansee it.$#00004A drop of a blue star surrounded by the Sea.$#00005Remember, Triton... Long ago, you were born out there,in space, in the galaxy of gods...$#00009So you must be Triton. Let me take a good look at you.Oh, you have grown up so much! It is all thanks to youthat I am my old self again.$#00010I have so much to tell you, but now is not the time.You must fulfil your destiny. I am giving you my crest,the crest of Apollo.$#00011Remove the last sword from the statue of Rhea and placeit on the pedestal.$#00012No, I cannot do this. The Hydra can only be sealed byyou. Have you forgotten the prophecy?$#00013'When the rich Aegean Sea falls into heaven,The Sea of Life will turn into drops of deathAnd turn all life to stone.$#00014All light will be extinguished,And the universe will be shrouded in darknessUntil the drops of the Seas of heaven and earth fall.'$#00015The drop of Seas of heaven and earth is you, Triton, thechild of Poseidon, the patron god of the Sea. Now put mysword, the sword of Love, on the pedestal.$#00016Together we will bring back the Sea and the Sun. You,who have the blood of Poseidon in your veins, are ableto create the Sea.$#00017Now, Triton, think back on the bountiful Aegean Sea...where you swam with your father when you were a baby...$#00018So that gentle voice is you, Triton. I am Apollo,goddess of the Sun. Forgive me for summoning you sofar away.$#00019But you are the only one who can save the galaxyof gods.$#00020The seal of the swords is broken, and the Hydra is aboutto awaken. If this happens, our galaxy of gods and theentire universe will perish.$#00021We must seal the Hydra before it's too late. Gather thefive swords of goddesses, and restore the Sea and theSun to this world.$#00022I know that I am asking a lot, with you having just lostyour father. But you are our only hope.$#00023Triton... Gather the swords of goddesses... You are...$#00024Triton... Triton... Where are you?$#00025Triton... There you are, hiding in there again. Oh, yourascal.$#00026What? You want me to hold you? Oh, you're such a spoiltchild... Goodness, Triton, you're getting heavy.$#00027Soon you'll grow up and grow a beard like your dad.Grow up quickly and be strong.$#00034Lady Apollo is back! Thank you, Triton, you are thebest person the whole universe! Quick, seal the Hydra!I'll give you lots of kisses later!$#00035Triton, save everyone in the temple.$#00036Triton, what do I do? The Hydra roared again. Baba saidthat after two or three more roars it will wake up. Soonthe galaxy of gods will be destroyed!$#00037That's a lie! I refuse to believe that you have Medusa'sblood in your veins!$#00038What's wrong, Triton? Don't say it's nothing. Please,talk to me. What happened?$#00039Triton, could you stay here for a while? Don't leave meall alone.$#00040Cursed blood? Emeralia did say you had a secret. Maybethat's what she meant?$#00041Triton, be my boyfriend just for a moment. And if not,for a moment, stay with me forever. Just don't leave mealone. Please.$#00042Triton! I just heard a horrible roar from under thepedestal. I'm so scared. I think the Hydra is aboutto awaken. Please, hurry up!$#00043The Hydra is sealed deep underneath this temple. If itwakes up, we will be the first to die. I don't want todie without a boyfriend!$#00044Have you met Narcissus? He likes guys. But you likegirls better, right?$#00045Sapphires are said to be the nobility among gems.Like... princes, you know? Triton, I want a sapphire!Buy me one!$#00046I heard that Druia's grandfather had a sapphire. I betDruia will wear it on her tiara when she gets married.$#00047That's so lovely. I want a sapphire too!$#00048Triton, keep it together. Don't give in to Lucia'scharms.$#00049I know how we can get Lucia to talk. Just takeLady Metis with you!$#00050Lucia doesn't get along with Lady Metis, so with herby your side, I'm sure Lucia will let you see Aphrodite.$#00051Hey, Triton, why don't you come along with me on a date?It's so boring being there on my own, let's go ona double date.$#00052I'll leave it to Bermuda or Lucia to explain thewindmill trick... What? Lucia won't tell you? Ha-ha-ha!She'll so use it as bait.$#00053Don't fall for it. She'll drag you on endless datesinstead of telling you. She does this with everyhandsome guy she sees.$#00054Hey, have you met Bermuda? He's been looking kind ofpale and shaky for a while now. I fear he might comedown with anaemia before his date.$#00055Lucia is a cunning one, you better watch out.$#00056Do you have a golden apple? The entrance to the Templeof Beauty is straight ahead from the this temple.$#00057Triton, your face seems to have grown firmer. When wefirst met, you looked more like Trollovich, but now youlook a lot more handsome.$#00058You're going to the Temple of Beauty now, right? Then becareful around Lucia. She has a quick wit.$#00059I'm so happy that Metis gave you her crest. She's verystrict.$#00060Is Lady Metis in a bad mood? That's very unusual. She'susually so calm and collected.$#00061Have you spoken to the Dandelion Princess?$#00062Back when you were little, did you roll around dungbeetles and play with caterpillars? I knew you did!So did I.$#00063See that stone statue on the left without the sword init? That's Lady Kronos. When I was a kid, I used to playwith dung beetles by that statue.$#00064Draw a triple circle. The circle outside is the Sea.Inside it is the land, and the sky is in the middle.And in the middle of the sky is the Sun.$#00065That would mean that there is a Sea both above yourhead and below your feet, right?$#00066How can there be seas both in the sky and on earth?That's easy. The galaxy of gods is in a ball made ofwater. It's a three-layered ball.$#00067The outermost ball is the Sea. The ball inside is theland and the temple, and the ball inside it is the sky.And in the sky is the Sun shining.$#00068That means there are seas both in the sky and on theearth.$#00069What's the solution? Oh, Lady Metis told me not to tellyou. But I can say in secret what happens next. A bridgewill come up over the water.$#00070You'll have to think on your own feet.$#00071Have you met Emeralia? She really hates Bermuda. And youknow why? I almost choked with laughter when I firstheard. She says he touched her butt.$#00072You wouldn't do that, would you? You're old enough toknow better.$#00073Triton, keep it up!$#00074Don't joke around with Emeralia. Or she'll give youthe cold shoulder.$#00075Why are you smiling? Did something good happen? Oh,you got the iron apple, too? Great! Now you can go tothe Temple of the Titans.$#00076Emeralia will provide all the assistance you need. Andif you have any problems, come to me. I'm always happyto help.$#00077What's with the smile? Oh, isn't that Lady Artemis'ssword? She gave you her crest! Great! keep up the goodwork and find the remaining swords.$#00078Old Worme and Druia are both upset over something. Couldyou pop out and talk to them?$#00079Have you met Lady Artemis? She's such a glutton. Youcould sit there talking to her about serious things,and she'd be munching on cake!$#00080She'd always compete with Lord Poseidon at banquetsover who could eat more.$#00081I'm glad it worked out in the end. You look happy.$#00082Be sure to speak to Druia heart-to-heart.$#00083What? Me, go on a date with Bermuda? But Bermuda likesDruia! Plead as much as you like, but you have to giveme a good reason.$#00084Ha-ha! The famous Sphinx trap! I guess Bermuda's beingmean and not telling you... Okay. I'll help you. I'lleven go on a date if Druia comes along.$#00085Triton, you're not giving up, are you?$#00086What's the matter? If it's about the Sphinx trap, askBermuda.$#00087What's the matter, Triton? What can I do for you?$#00088When you go to the Temple of the Moon, see Druia.I'm sure she can help you.$#00089You got the silver apple! Great! Now you can go to theTemple of the Moon. Go up to the Tower of the Sphinx.$#00090What is it, Triton? Don't worry about Bermuda. I'm justa little jumpy, that's all. I'll wait here, and you goon up to Mount Athos.$#00091Triton, I have great news! Bermuda found a silver appleon Mount Athos. With it, you can open portals! Go get itbefore Bermuda uses it.$#00092Portals are doors to the other four temples... Well,they're not really doors, but more like square holes.But they're very handy!$#00093Portals allow you to get to other temples in an instant.$#00094After divining with the crystal ball, Baba said thatthe remaining four swords are in the other temples.$#00095You tried to pull out the sword from the statue of LadyRhea? That's one of the swords that sealed the Hydra.It is the sword of Lady Apollo.$#00096There used to be four more swords of goddesses on thepedestal, but they are all gone now.$#00097Did you see the sword stuck in the statue of Lady Rhea?The one on your right, with a sword in it. That's her.$#00098The one on your left is Lady Kronos, Queen of the Gods.$#00099So you're Triton. Heh. You must take after your Earthmother. I'm Cecilia.$#00100I used to be Lady Apollo's priestess, helping her andcleaning the Sun. Now I remain in this temple onlybecause Apollo has turned to stone.$#00101I'm sorry about your father, Poseidon. He was so niceand friendly... I'm sure he was a wonderful dad to you,too.$#00102I know it's hard for you, but do your best and find theswords of goddesses.$#00103If you're looking for Lady Apollo, she's straight ahead.$#00104What can I do for you? What is your name?$#00105Hello! I don't think I've seen you here before. Whichtemple are you from?$#00107Your Lordship, please hurry!$#00108You have become a man, Lord Triton. Looking at you, Isee the young Lord Poseidon. Now, hurry to the pedestal.$#00109Your Lordship, Lady Metis is looking to talk to you.$#00110It's a lie! Impossible! Lord Triton can't have the sameblood as Medusa! No!..$#00111Your Lordship, don't worry about your blood. There can'tbe cursed blood in such a fine man as you.$#00112That's ridiculous! There is no way Your Lordship's bloodis cursed! Your have such virtuous parents, why wouldyour blood be cursed?$#00113Your Lordship, have you seen Cecilia? She heard the roarof the Hydra. That monster of destruction is about toawaken from its eternal slumber.$#00114If the Hydra roars nine times, it will be the end of theworld. Please, Lord Triton, save us all!$#00115Only the Temple of Wisdom remains... Lady Apollo, I prayto you, give your blessing to Lord Triton!$#00116Your Lordship, your face has changed quite a bit. And Ithink your eyes have become sharper, too.$#00117Lord Poseidon fell in love with Lady Aphrodite, and usedto visit the Temple of Beauty every day.$#00118Lady Apollo tried to reason with him, but he wouldn'tlisten. So Aphrodite had Bermuda set up the windmill.$#00119Lord Poseidon used to quarrel with Bermuda all the timebecause of it.$#00120Sorry for being all gloom and doom... If you're havingtrouble with the windmill, don't ask Trollovich. Theywouldn't tell him the trick.$#00121A weak man like him would fold in an instant if LordPoseidon were to threaten him.$#00122If there's anyone who knows the solution, it's Bermuda.He's strong-minded enough not to give it away underLord Poseidon's threats.$#00123I hear the noise of drops of death outside. I hope noone else dies... After all, Lady Apollo was turned tostone by those same drops of death.$#00124Medusa tried to turn the entire galaxy of gods to stone,but Lady Apollo tapped into the power of the Sun andvaporised most of them.$#00125But her power wasn't enough, and there still remainedone last drop of death. And that drop turned Lady Apolloto stone.$#00126Have you met Lady Aphrodite?$#00127Your Lordship, I think your face has become more rugged.You remind me of Lord Poseidon in his youth.$#00128Is that the sword of Lady Metis, imbued with the powerof Courage? Now you must go to the Temple of Beauty,where you'll meet Lady Aphrodite.$#00129Your Lordship, don't let your guard down. The Hydra hasnot been sealed yet.$#00130I think Lady Metis is mourning for the old days in thegalaxy of gods, before it was disturbed by Medusa.$#00131Your Lordship, the Dandelion Princess has been lookingfor you. She wants to talk to you about something.$#00132For the puzzle in the Temple of the Titans, you willhave to think on your feet, Lord Triton. Then all theanswers will be at your feet.$#00133Did Emeralia suspect you were Medusa? That's to beexpected. Medusa is a sorceress, so Emeralia is wise tobe wary of her evil ways.$#00134After all, it was Medusa who took Lord Poseidon's life.She came to the Temple of the Sea and got him to drinkthe blood of the Hydra.$#00135Lord Poseidon went mad and threw the seawater into theSun. Then he came back to his senses and rushed to stopthe Sea, but it was too late.$#00136The Temple of the Sea was destroyed, and Lord Poseidonfell into the Sun never to be seen again...$#00137Please, for the sake of Lord Poseidon, save the galaxyof gods! Do not let Medusa have her way!$#00138The Temple of the Titans is also known as the graveyardof the Titans. The statues rising out of the water looklike the corpses the Titans.$#00139Your Lordship, don't let the same tragedy befall us!Gather the swords of goddesses and seal the Hydra beforeit awakens.$#00140Have you met Lady Metis?$#00141I'll be waiting here, Your Lordship. Please don't keepLady Metis waiting.$#00142Is that the sword of Lady Artemis, imbued with the powerof Pleasure? You can't seal the Hydra without it. Now,hurry to the Temple of the Titans.$#00143I'm sure Lady Metis is looking forward to meeting you.$#00144Your Lordship, did you find any apples lying around inthe Temple of the Moon?$#00145Your Lordship, you need the crest of Lady Artemis. Didyou forget? Without the crest, you can't pull out thesword of the goddess.$#00146Have you met Lady Artemis? She loves food so much.$#00147I once brought her some sweets, and she was so giddy sheate them right there, munching as she greeted me.$#00148Your Lordship, keep it up!$#00149I'm sorry, Your Lordship. I don't know anything aboutthat trap. That Sphinx statues were built in case theevil Medusa came for revenge.$#00150Just don't listen to Worme's advice on women!$#00151Your Lordship, hurry to the Temple of the Moon. A mannamed Worme will help you there.$#00152Your Lordship, is that a silver apple? Oh, praiseMerciful Apollo! May we forever be safe under herwatchful eye!$#00153Oh dear, you want me to walk you to Mount Athos? I'd behappy to, but with my legs... I'm sorry, Your Lordship.I can't help you there.$#00154But I can show you the way. Head left from here. Whenyou get to the end of the road, turn left and gostraight ahead.$#00155You will see a mountain path - that's Mount Athos. Andif you get lost along the way, ask Bermuda.$#00156Cecilia was making a fuss about something.$#00157You mustn't go outside. The air there is full of dropsof death that will turn you to stone if you touch them.Just wait for Bermuda to make new apples.$#00158You need the crest of the goddess to pull out her sword.$#00159Long ago, Lady Kronos gave her life to seal the Hydra,and the five goddesses used their crests to prevent theswords from being taken by an evil person.$#00160Your Lordship, have you seen Lady Apollo's sword? Theseare the swords that you must find.$#00161Have you spoken to Lady Apollo? She may look like astone statue, but I'm sure her heart is still beating.$#00162My heart aches for you. Long ago, you lost your Earthmother, and now your father, Lord Poseidon, has sufferedthe same fate.$#00163Why is life so unfair?!$#00164Lord Triton! My goodness, you have come a long way! I'mAmus, the gardener here. You've grown up, haven't you?$#00165I remember when you were just a baby. Back then, the skyand the earth were filled with Seas, and the Sun wasshining... Now, everything is in ruins.$#00166I wish your father were here. Lord Poseidon would bringthe Sea back in an instant!$#00167I'm in your debt, Triton. It's all thanks to you thatthe Sea is back and I got close with Druia. I'll missyou, but I'm sure we'll meet again.$#00168I'll be looking forward to it. Be sure to get yourselfa girlfriend.$#00169What? Druia said that?.. What the hell! Druia, wait forme! Bermuda's coming to you!$#00170Triton, do something. My love and my life depend on you.$#00171This is bad. The Hydra roared again. The monster isabout to wake up! And I was just getting to know Druia!Damn it!$#00172Triton, what's wrong? You look like a ghost. What thehell happened?$#00173You seem worried. Is it about Narcissus? Don't fret,I'll talk to him. I owe you my life, after all.$#00174I've already made silver, gold, and iron apples. Yousee, when you have a girl you like, you put your heartinto your work. Find yourself one.$#00175Be careful around Narcissus. In a way, he's scarier thanthe Hydra itself. His psychological attacks willpenetrate anything.$#00176Druia is so cute. She's the best of the priestesses...no, the best of all the goddesses combined!$#00177Triton, I was so nervous! And Druia was nervous, too!She is so cute when she's blushing. She looks manly,but when I held her hand, it was so soft.$#00178And oh, her lips... They are the softest. I don't evenremember what we talked about. But we agreed to meetagain.$#00179Triton, it's all thanks to you! You're my saviour!You're... my Cupid!$#00180Sometimes you have to persuade a woman.$#00181I'm so giddy I almost forgot. Cecilia was looking foryou.$#00182Druia was nervous too? Oh, I'm so happy! I feel likemy heart is about to jump out of my chest!$#00183Damn, I'm so nervous I'm about to throw up.$#00184Ugh, Triton, help me... I can't sit still any more.How early do you think I should get there?$#00185I'm sorry, but could you go check on Druia for me? Or Idon't know, I'll...$#00186Ugh, I'm getting nervous again... Triton, do something!My heart is about to explode! I think I'm gonna throwup...$#00187The Temple of Beauty really is beautiful, isn't it? IfI'm going to meet up with a girl, it has to be in frontof the Sphinx there.$#00188If you don't know the way, ask Cecilia.$#00189Hey, it's our future hero! Looking good, my man! You'vegotten a little more manly now, I tell ya.$#00190Oh! You found the sword of Metis! Neat! Next is theTemple of Beauty. There's a portal across from the maintemple. Give my regards to Trollovich.$#00191Hey, Triton! How are you?$#00192Did you get to meet Metis? That's good. I've justfinished making silver apples. I should make her someiron apples, she'll like that.$#00193The Dandelion Princess has been looking for you. Sheseemed very eager to talk to you.$#00194Sorry, I can't go on a date with Druia without one.$#00195How did you like the Temple of the Titans? That's theirgraveyard. There used to be a lot of Titans, but Medusaand the Hydra wiped them out.$#00196The disappearance of the Sea and the Sun was part ofMedusa's plan. She's a sorceress, and she casts cursesin the form of prophecies.$#00197'When the rich Aegean Sea falls into heaven,The Sea of Life will turn into drops of deathAnd turn all life to stone.$#00198All light will be extinguished,And the universe will be shrouded in darknessUntil the drops of the Seas of heaven and earth fall.'$#00199Medusa cursed the Sun to turn everyone to stone when itmade contact with the seawater. She's evil like that.$#00200Thank goodness Apollo used the Sun's power to vaporizethe water. If it weren't for her, everyone would bestone by now.$#00201Sorry, no time to waste. I need to make silver apples.If you seek advice, you'll have to ask someone else.$#00202Don't joke around with Metis.$#00203When you go to the Temple of the Titans, be careful notto touch Emeralia's butt by accident. Or she'll nevertalk to you again.$#00204It never fails once I'm involved, I'm forging applesout of gold... Oh, hello! What's up with the smile?Ah, you found an iron apple!$#00205The Temple of the Titans is straight ahead. It's up thenarrow path and through the tower portal, a snowy place.It's a proper fairyland!$#00206Don't worry, Metis herself isn't, like, a huge Titan.A bit masculine, but women like her will give you allyou want if they fall in love with you.$#00207Triton, if you're going to marry, why don't you marry awoman like Metis? You'll be her little plaything, ha-ha!$#00208If you can't pull the sword out, try pushing it. Isn'tthat how the old saying goes? 'If you can't pull it,push.'$#00209You think it's hard? My, you and Artemis are like twopeas in a pod. Look, how many times do you press theblue button and the red button?$#00210The answer is written on the tablet. Count the blueand the red dots. Then press the respective buttonsthe correct number of times.$#00211If you do it wrong, the Sphinx will push you back again.$#00212Really? She said yes? Woohoo! Damn, that's worth livingfor! Yes! I love it!$#00213Damn, Triton, you're good! I underestimated you, youbeautiful bastard! I'll teach you the trick like Ipromised.$#00214You need to press the blue and the red buttons aspecific number of times. The answer is written on thetablet. Note the blue and red dots.$#00215Just press the buttons the correct number of times. Itused to be more complicated, but Artemis said it was toohard, so I made it easy.$#00216I hope she said yes. What, you haven't asked her yet?Well, go and ask her!$#00217Go on a date with Cecilia? Didn't you hear what I said?I want to hold hands with Druia, not her.$#00218What? A date with Fati? But I said Druia! I don't wantthat flower girl.$#00219I said, go right now.$#00220Hey, it's the apple thief!.. Listen, have you met Druia?She's a nice girl. Madly in love with me, too. And she'sso cute when she denies it.$#00221You want me to tell you the trick of the Sphinx? Well,I'll consider it if you set me up on a date with Druia.Go talk to her right now.$#00222Now give me back my apple. It's my turn to use it.$#00223Give it back! It's mine! You're interfering withsomeone's love!$#00224Oh, isn't that the silver apple I found? Don't take itaway, it's mine to use!$#00225I found an apple on Mount Athos, it's a key to a portal.They say, all roads lead to the Temple of the Sun. Itused to be so beautiful here.$#00226There used to be four kinds of apples: silver, copper,iron, and gold. You could get to any temple via portals.And your father ruined it all.$#00227Is there another way to get to other temples? Well, youcan go outside and walk. But don't blame me if you turnto stone.$#00228Your father is the reason there are all those bubblesfloating around. Drops of death. If you touch one ofthose, you'll turn to stone.$#00229Imagine touching one of these bubbles while you're inthe bathroom. You'll be the laughing stock of thegalaxy!$#00230And by 'apples' I don't mean some red juicy apples.Those are special apples made of metal and filled withhigh tech.$#00231If you want to go to other temples, you have to find theapples. Without them, you can't open the portals.$#00232Why are you still here? If you have nothing to do, gopull out the sword that's stuck in Lady Rhea's statue.$#00233You don't look like your father at all. Well, it's forthe better. I get mad when I see Poseidon's face.$#00234That drunkard, he'd always get close to me, reeking ofalcohol, and tell me that if I'm a man, I should drink.You don't drink, do you?$#00235You're Triton, aren't you? Why are you so calm? The Seais gone because of your drunken old man!$#00236I can't even go girl hunting on the beach now... What?It's not your fault? Well, it's your father's fault, soyou're to clean up the mess.$#00238Please hurry and tell everyone here that you'll makethings right!$#00239I won't say anything else. I just want everyone to besafe... even if it means parting ways with you, Triton.$#00240Are you still not feeling well? What should I do?I wonder if Artemis could cheer you up.$#00241Don't worry, Triton. Even if your aunt is Medusa, Istill like you. There's no way someone who loves flowershas an evil heart.$#00242I won't be bringing Lady Athena any more flowers.$#00243No matter how much I like Lady Athena, how can she saysuch a thing to you?! That's unforgivable!$#00244To claim your blood is cursed is to insult Lord Poseidonhimself! Triton, give me your apple. I'll go and talksome sense into her.$#00245Ah, if you want me to keep living, then I'll live...But in return, please cheer up. You're not yourself.$#00246Something is bothering you, isn't it? Can you tell mewhat it is?$#00247Triton, if I die, will you bring flowers to my grave?I might be dead soon. The Hydra has awakened.$#00248The Temple of the Sun will be gone too. But I'm gladI met you, Triton... I'm sorry, I'm just so scared.$#00249I feel like I may never see you again...$#00250Triton, what do you think of Lady Aphrodite?$#00251Did Lady Aphrodite say anything?.. Oh, Triton, I toldyou she was majestic!$#00252Triton, what did you think of Lucia?$#00253Did Lucia really say that? So what are you going to do,Triton?$#00254Druia is going on a date with Bermuda. Oh, Triton! Youdon't have time for such things, do you? You have tosave the galaxy of the gods.$#00255Isn't the Temple of Beauty lovely? I wish we could gothere together.$#00256Please be careful!$#00257I'm so happy you got the sword of Lady Metis. No, don'tthank me. You're going to the Temple of Beauty, right?Say hello to Lucia for me.$#00258I just wanted you to meet Lady Metis.$#00259I'm so glad you got to meet Lady Metis. It makes meso happy... But you don't care if I'm happy or not.It's okay.$#00260If you promise me that, I'll tell you. There's a tabletin front of the Temple of the Titans. Press the buttonsalong the road as shown there.$#00261A bridge will come up if you do it right. But don't tellanyone that I revealed the trick.$#00262Will you come see me again?$#00263No, sorry, I can't. Lady Metis will get angry with me...$#00264You're looking for someone to help you when you're introuble? Oh, Triton, are you in trouble?$#00265You mean the puzzle in the Temple of the Titans? LadyMetis told me that I shouldn't reveal the trick. Butsince it's you, I just might...$#00266I'm sorry, I keep talking about all these dark things.You don't like me bringing them up? I understand.$#00267I thought maybe you didn't like me because I always endup being all gloom and doom.$#00268Triton, have you ever been in love? I haven't. Bermuda'sa bit rough... I don't like rough people. What kind ofgirls do you like?$#00269I'm glad you came here again. I hope Lady Apollo comesback to life soon. The Sun here shines with the powerof her Love.$#00270The Sun is gone because Lady Apollo has turned to stone,but there is still light because her Love persists.$#00271But one day, the world will go dark.$#00272You don't have seas in the sky back home? Then you can'tknow how there could be seas up there... I wish Ceciliawas here, she'd explain it better.$#00273Hello, Triton! I see you're back from the Temple of theTitans. Have you met Lady Metis?.. I've been looking upat the sky this whole time.$#00274It's now a cold leaden colour. But people used to callour galaxy the galaxy of water, and there were seas inthe sky and on earth.$#00275When the weather was nice, you could see the Temple ofWisdom and the Temple of the Titans up in the sky. Itwas very beautiful.$#00276Triton, please don't give up.$#00277If you get lost along the way, ask Bermuda.$#00278Why are you smiling, Triton? Oh, you found an ironapple! Now you can get to the Temple of the Titans.$#00279You see that narrow path extending from Mount Athosacross the sky, leading to the tower? There's a portalin that tower at the end of it.$#00280You look so happy, Triton. Did something good happen?Oh, you got the sword of Lady Artemis! There are onlyfour left. Keep it up!$#00281I know about the Hydra, although I've only seen it inpictures. It's a terrible monster.$#00282I think you can't pull out a sword of a goddess withouther crest.$#00283I heard that Artemis has a penchant for food. Whenevershe comes to visit, she eats all day long.$#00284What? Druia is going on a date with Bermuda? I see...$#00285If you're looking for a date, talk to Cecilia. Evenbetter, why don't you ask her out?$#00286Hello, Triton. I was a little lonely when you were gone.Are you here to see the flowers?.. I hope Lady Apollocomes back to normal soon.$#00287The Sun will return, and the flowers... What? A date?At a time like this? What with the flowers, the Sun,and the Sea all gone?$#00288But if it's okay with you, Triton...$#00289Oh, you mean a date with Bermuda? No, I don't want to goon a date with someone who doesn't care about flowers.Talk to Cecilia.$#00290I'll support you whatever you do, Triton.$#00291Triton, I know it must be hard being on your own, butplease don't give up.$#00292Triton, this silver apple should open the portal to theTemple of the Moon. Please go there as soon as possible.$#00293Isn't that the silver apple glittering on Mount Athosbehind you? Bermuda must have dug it up. He seems tohave taken great care polishing it.$#00294A portal is a passage through another dimension. Whenyou come up to it with an apple, the portal opens,taking you to another temple.$#00295The were four kinds of apples, but they're all gonebecause of the evil Medusa.$#00296The five swords of goddesses were sent flying by theevil Medusa. Only one of them, the sword of Apollo,remained in this temple.$#00297Are you looking for the swords of goddesses? The swordof Lady Apollo is stuck in the statue of Rhea in thecentral temple.$#00298The sky has been dark and foreboding ever since theevil Medusa came for revenge.$#00299I wish Lady Apollo came back to life. Then the Sun wouldreturn, and the sky would be bright again...$#00300I'm sorry for being so gloomy... Triton, what kind offlowers do you like? White lilies? That's so sweet.And I like dandelions.$#00301Do you like flowers? It's so rare for a boy to likeflowers. Are you Triton, by any chance? My name is Fati.$#00302I bring flowers to the temple every day. Not too longago, there used to be lots of flowers around here, butnow the Sun is gone...$#00304I'm sorry for all the harsh things I've said. I hopeyou'll forgive this old lady for being so grumpy.$#00305Don't worry about me. Hurry up to Lady Apollo andfulfil your destiny.$#00306Medusa was very kind before she became evil. It wasshe who created the most beautiful Sea in the universe.But she was unhappy.$#00307She couldn't bear children. That's why she was so fondof the Hydra. I can't blame her for turning againstLady Kronos and Lady Rhea.$#00308Medusa loved the Hydra as her own child, and they toldher to kill it. She is not evil at all.$#00309Triton, you have to be strong. It doesn't matter whoyour aunt is. What matters is who you are. As long asyou're strong, no one will care.$#00310Oh, Lady Athena! What were you thinking?$#00311Don't think about the cursed blood. You have to thinkabout the future... Honestly, I didn't expect that fromLady Athena.$#00312You don't seem to be in good spirits, or is it just myimagination? What's wrong?$#00313Cecilia has already told you, hasn't she? We must keepcalm in times of trouble. We can't do anything aboutwhat has already happened.$#00314Either the Hydra awakens, or you seal it first. I trustyou with my own life. It's not worth much, but do takecare of it.$#00315By the way, is it true that Druia went on a date withBermuda? Oh, these young girls. What's so good aboutthose skirt chasers?$#00316You've got three swords now. Only two more left. Goodluck, I'm counting on you.$#00317What happened to the sword of Lady Aphrodite?$#00318Are you going to tell me what's going on with Bermuda?He's been acting strange for a while now.$#00319Lucia won't tell you? Oh, that insufferable girl. I'msure Lady Aphrodite will have a good talk with her.$#00320Have you met Lady Aphrodite? She's so beautiful, justlike me.$#00321Don't thank me. Hurry up and go see Lady Aphrodite.$#00322Take good care of the sword of Metis. It has the powerof Courage... What is it, child? Don't thank me. Hurryto the Temple of Beauty!$#00323You don't have to thank me. Hurry up and get the swordof Metis.$#00324Have you met Lady Metis? Isn't she wonderful?.. What?She's being capricious? Oh dear... Actually, I seem toremember she really likes olives.$#00325Whenever she runs out of olives, she gets moody. In theold days, she would drink and go on a rampage withLord Poseidon.$#00326Here, take these olives. I'm sure they will put LadyMetis in a better mood.$#00327The Dandelion Princess looked sad. If you have time,please go talk to her.$#00328If you've got nothing to do, go somewhere. Say, theTemple of the Moon or wherever you want.$#00329Emeralia suspected you of being Medusa?.. Wait, youdidn't touch her bum like Bermuda did, by any chance?$#00330Where's the sword of Lady Metis? Don't come backempty-handed.$#00331What are you doing? Go get the sword of Lady Metis.$#00332Oh, you've got the iron apple? You can now go to theTemple of the Titans. Come on, don't dawdle. Go seeLady Metis.$#00333Don't get carried away having pulled out one sword.There are still four left. And there's only one apple.Did you find any apples there?$#00334I have seen the Hydra too. It's something that does notbelong in this world.$#00335When you meet Artemis, don't let her drag you intosomething silly. She's always in the mood for a party.And you have important work to do.$#00336'When the rich Aegean Sea falls into heaven,The Sea of Life will turn into drops of deathAnd turn all life to stone.$#00337All light will be extinguished,And the universe will be shrouded in darknessUntil the drops of the Seas of heaven and earth fall.'$#00338Since you're here, you should at least remember thisprophecy.$#00339Have you met Worme? He's a good man. If you want to bea good man yourself, you should learn from him.$#00340Go on up to the tower of the Sphinx... Oh, wait!If you see Worme, tell him I'm fine.$#00341Looks like it's fate. A long time ago, a goddess whowas a powerful sorceress left us with this prophecy.$#00342'When the rich Aegean Sea falls into heaven,The Sea of Life will turn into drops of deathAnd turn all life to stone.$#00343All light will be extinguished,And the universe will be shrouded in darknessUntil the drops of the Seas of heaven and earth fall.'$#00344It says that you can bring back the Sun and the Seathat we've lost. You should remember that.$#00345Now, go up to the tower of the Sphinx and travel tothe Temple of the Moon.$#00346Bermuda seems to have been awfully loud lately. Didhe get ants in his proverbial unmentionables?$#00347Oh, where did the apple go?$#00348I used to use those portals all the time. I could go tothe Temple of the Titans, or wherever I wanted. Just hadto have an apple on me.$#00349The swords of goddesses can only seal the Hydra if youhave five of them. If you have none, they're useless.$#00350What are you waiting for? Time is of the essence! Go on,chop-chop!$#00351'When the rich Aegean Sea falls into heaven,The Sea of Life will turn into drops of deathAnd turn all life to stone.$#00352All light will be extinguished,And the universe will be shrouded in darknessUntil the drops of the Seas of heaven and earth fall.'$#00353You must be Triton. My name is Baba. I'm Lady Apollo'sadviser... Oh, you look just like your mother.$#00354And you don't look like Poseidon at all. So thin...How are you going to restore the Sea and the Sun? I'mworried about the universe.$#60000Sword of ApolloOne of the swords that sealed the Hydra.$#60001Sword of ArtemisOne of the swords that sealed the Hydra.$#60002Sword of MetisOne of the swords that sealed the Hydra.$#60003Sword of AphroditeOne of the swords that sealed the Hydra.$#60004Sword of AthenaOne of the swords that sealed the Hydra.$#60005Silver AppleKey to the Temple of the Moon.$#60006Iron AppleKey to the Temple of the Titans.$#60007Golden AppleKey to the Temple of Beauty.$#60008Copper AppleKey to the Temple of Wisdom.$#60009Round stoneUnknown.$#60010Square stoneUnknown.$#60011Star-shaped stoneUnknown.$#60012Triangular stoneUnknown.$#60013SapphireEye of the Sphinx.$#60014OlivesFavourite food of Lady Metis.$#60015Crest of ApolloReleases the sword of the goddess.$#60016Crest of ArtemisReleases the sword of the goddess.$#60017Crest of MetisReleases the sword of the goddess.$#60018Crest of AphroditeReleases the sword of the goddess.$#60019Crest of AthenaReleases the sword of the goddess.$#60020- - - - - - N O T H I N G - - - - - -$#60021I took the silver apple.$#60022I've already taken the silver apple.$#60023I've already taken the sword of Apollo.$#60024I drew the sword of Apollo.$#60025I couldn't draw the sword of Apollo.$#60026I took the round stone.$#60027I've already taken the round stone.$#60028I drew the sword of Artemis.$#60029I couldn't draw the sword of Artemis.$#60030I took the iron apple.$#60031I've already taken the iron apple.$#60032I took the square stone.$#60033I've already taken the square stone.$#60034I drew the sword of Metis.$#60035I couldn't draw the sword of Metis.$#60036I took the golden apple.$#60037I've already taken the golden apple.$#60038I took the star-shaped stone.$#60039I've already taken the star-shaped stone.$#60040I took the copper apple.$#60041I've already taken the copper apple.$#60042I took the triangular stone.$#60043I've already taken the triangular stone.$#60044I drew the sword of Aphrodite.$#60045I couldn't draw the sword of Aphrodite.$#60046I drew the sword of Athena.$#60047I couldn't draw the sword of Athena.$#60048The sword of Apollo is placed on the pedestal.$#60049The sword of Artemis is placed on the pedestal.$#60050The sword of Metis is placed on the pedestal.$#60051The sword of Aphrodite is placed on the pedestal.$#60052The sword of Athena is placed on the pedestal.$#60053Apollo is now free from the curse.$#60100Are you sure you want to quit the game?Yes - left mouse button.No - right mouse button.$#10000You have saved not only the galaxy of gods, but theentire universe!$#10001The name Triton will always be remembered as the nameof the son of a great goddess who saved the universefrom the curse of the evil Medusa.$#10002I look forward to seeing you again.Goodbye... my sweet child.$#10003It's time to say goodbye. Thank you for everything,even though I'm a little embarrassed. Cecilia will missyou, come visit once in a while.$#10004How about you take Druia with you? I can convince her.I think you two would be perfect for each other.$#10005You have grown into a wonderful man. One that is worthyof having taken my sword... But do watch out for drinksand women. Blood is blood.$#10006Cecilia, Fati, Lucia, and even Aphrodite... They allseem to like you.$#10007Oh, please don't tell anyone that I like olives!..Farewell, Triton.$#10008Your Lordship, thank you very much. You are a true hero.When you're back home, don't get complacent and do yourbest. Take care.$#10009Triton, you are so beautiful. I wish you could stay withme forever. Why are you leaving? The Sea is back, soyou should stay too.$#10010Come swim with me sometime. I will show you my perfectbody. See you soon!$#10011You're a hero now. Next time we meet, I... I'll be justas cool as you are!$#10012Before you say goodbye, give me a big hug. And a hotkiss! And tell me you'll never let me go! Hey!..$#10013Thank you so much, Triton. I'm sorry we have to saygoodbye now. I wish we could talk a little longer.$#10014I don't mean to be weird, but we started out as friends,and now... No, what am I saying? Never mind... Pleasewrite to me.$#10015It's not fair that you're leaving me without a singlekiss. But our love grows even more with the distance!$#10016You've done well. I'm so proud of you. Feel free tostop by when you have time.$#10017I won't cry, I shouldn't... I believe we'll meet again,Triton. So I won't say goodbye.$#10018Triton, how are you? Have you forgotten about me,surrounded by all those girls back on Earth?.. I missyou when you're gone.$#10019Let's go to the Windmill of Memories sometime? I heardit's around here somewhere, but Fati won't tell me.$#10020Let's go look for it together. You like adventures,don't you?.. Oh, and let's go to a concert too!$#10021You see, I'm going to give a concert. I know a verynice concert hall, I keep it in my heart.$#10022Look into my heart, and you can hear beautiful musicthat will bring back many memories. Don't be shy.Come and listen.$#10023Thank you for all your hard work. I'm sad to saygoodbye, but I'll come visit with Apollo's permission.Take care!$#10024I'm in your debt, Triton. You brought the Sea back,and got me together with Druia... I'll miss you, but I'msure we'll meet again.$#10025Your Lordship, thank you. You have saved the universe.I am sure Lord Poseidon will be happy to see you in theafterlife.$#10026Triton, woohoo! That's my little munchkin! Ha-ha-ha!Hey, can I have your autograph?.. Oh, you're so cutewhen you're embarrassed.$#10027By the way, are you leaving already?.. I'll miss you.I wish we could play more. But you'll come back again,right?$#10028When you do, let's play together, all of us. Druia,old Worme, Cecilia, Bermuda, everyone... Goodbye!$#20000Your Lordship, what are you playing with?$#20001I can't give you this wheel.$#20002The wheel is starting to give.$#20003The wheel is rattling.$#20004The wheel is about to come off.$#20005The wheel has gone wonky.$#20006The wheel is losing air.$#20007The wheel deflated, and a tube came out.$#20008Turns out, it was a black wiener.$#20009The wiener looks pretty good.$#20010Will you eat the black wiener?Eat it - left mouse button.Don't eat it - right mouse button.$#20011The wiener was absolutely disgusting.$#20012I didn't eat it.I wonder what would've happened if I'd eaten it.$@
