#00000
You have grown into a wonderful man. One that is worthy
of having taken my sword... But do watch out for drinks
and women. Blood is blood.$
#00001
Cecilia, Fati, Lucia, and even Aphrodite... They all
seem to like you.$
#00002
Oh, please don't tell anyone that I like olives!..
Farewell, Triton.$
#00003
Hurry! There's no time to look back.$
#00004
Go, Triton! The fate of the universe is in your hands.
You must bring Apollo back to life and seal the Hydra
before it awakens!$
#00005
There are many winds in life. You can feel them now.
Don't succumb to your fate. Stand strong, clench your
fists. Shed your boyish clothes.$
#00006
You look determined. Then I shall be your snake... Your
real aunt is not a human, but a goddess. You've never
met her, because she's not here.$
#00007
She is probably still holding a grudge against us in
the galaxy of nothingness beyond the universe... I
think you understand already.$
#00008
Your aunt is Medusa, the one who defied Lady Kronos,
wiped out the Titans, and stole the Seas and the Sun...
and stole your father from you.$
#00009
You refuse to believe it? But it is true. Medusa is the
real sister of your father, Poseidon. You have the same
blood as Medusa.$
#00010
Triton, do not look too deep into yourself. You're the
youngest here. Listen to those who are older and wiser.$
#00011
I have heard of the Hydra's return. There is no time
to waste. Triton, take the sword of Athena.$
#00012
Ask Emeralia about the elemental stones.$
#00013
Hurry to the Temple of Wisdom. We don't have much time.$
#00014
I can't just sit here hoping a sapphire will just
magically pop up. Let's dive into the lake and see what
we can find.$
#00015
There's no need to thank me.$
#00016
Is there something else?$
#00017
You've grown more handsome since we last met...
Heh-heh. Flattery is good, it makes one bashful. So
what brings you to me?$
#00018
I see. Show Lucia my sword, the sword of Metis. That
should make her more complaisant.$
#00019
A windmill hiding a passage, you say? Oh, Great
Aphrodite! You are a goddess, and yet you are so afraid
of Medusa?$
#00020
Are you here to complain about something?$
#00021
Triton, you really do look just like your mother.
Looking at you, I see... That I speak too much. Hurry
to the Temple of Beauty!$
#00022
This sword suits you well. Do you have the golden
apple? Head to the Temple of Beauty.$
#00023
Do you have business with Great Metis? Triton, I hate
being interrupted while I am eating olives. This is my
second least favourite thing.$
#00024
And my least favourite thing is running out of olives.
You may want to leave before I lose my temper.$
#00025
Where are those olives?.. It's about time! Baba gave
them to you, didn't she? Sorry about my outburst. Take
this as an apology.$
#00026
This is the crest of Metis. The future of the galaxy of
gods rests on your shoulders.$
#00027
The evil Medusa cursed the Aegean Sea to punish those
who sealed away the Hydra, which she loved like a child.$
#00028
To fulfil the curse, she sneaked into this galaxy and
cut off one of the Hydra's heads, mixing its blood with
wine, which she gave to Poseidon.$
#00029
The Sea ran dry and the Sun's fire went out. Having
realised the curse, Medusa mustered her magic and threw
our swords at each of us.$
#00030
The goddesses put up barriers to prevent the swords
from hitting them, but that drained them of their
power. We cannot oppose Medusa.$
#00031
And now the Hydra is about awaken with its eternal
seal broken. And you know what will happen if the Hydra
awakens.$
#00032
Whether the universe disappears or survives is up you.$
#00033
Go, Triton! Draw the sword of Metis and head to the
Temple of Beauty to meet Aphrodite. Emeralia will tell
you where the sword is.$
#00034
Didn't you hear me? I'm not in the mood to talk.$
#00035
I am Metis, goddess of the Titans. You have come a long
way. I knew your father, Poseidon.$
#00036
We weren't good friends... I'm sorry, I don't feel like
talking to you right now. I have to ask you to leave.$
#00037
Thank you, Lord Triton. You are a true hero. When you
get back to Earth, please keep doing your best.
Take care.$
#00038
I look forward to your return after you have defeated
the Hydra.$
#00039
Lord Triton, please bring Lady Apollo to life. Restore
the Sea and the Sun to the galaxy of gods.$
#00040
Lord Triton...$
#00041
Do not eat the fruit of Wisdom.$
#00042
Sometimes it is better not to know. Do you remember
what happened to those who bit into the fruit of Wisdom
in the Garden of Eden?$
#00043
I do not want to tempt you like the snake that enticed
Eve. Please leave.$
#00044
I don't know anything about that.$
#00045
In the beginning, there was nothing but space. There
was no time, no light.$
#00046
Kronos, Queen of the Gods, looked out over the universe
and said, 'Let this be our home.' And she created time.
Medusa and Poseidon created the Sea.$
#00047
Lady Rhea gave birth to the Sun and the five goddesses.
Medusa created the Hydra to help the Titans build the
nine temples.$
#00048
But after they built six temples, they could no longer
ignore an obvious problem.$
#00049
The Hydra was created to help build the temples. For
that purpose, it had the power to create things. But it
also had the power of destruction.$
#00050
Lady Kronos ordered the Titans to seal the Hydra away.
Medusa, who loved the Hydra like her own child, turned
against them and wiped them out.$
#00051
Lady Rhea died giving birth to the five magic swords,
and Lady Kronos gave her life to seal the Hydra with
them deep in the Temple of the Sun.$
#00052
Medusa was banished to the galaxy of nothingness, and
the remaining goddesses sealed their swords so they
could not be drawn by the heartless.$
#00053
Since then, Medusa has been called evil. But she was
a good goddess in the past.$
#00054
Even though Medusa took Poseidon's life, I don't think
she had any intention of doing so.$
#00055
Otherwise, she would not have gone to the galaxy of
nothingness with Lord Poseidon's body in her arms.$
#00056
Lady Athena created the elemental stones as a way to
remember the good goddess Medusa.$
#00057
The four elemental stones represent the four gods who
were there when the galaxy of gods was born.$
#00058
The round stone is Poseidon. The triangle stands for
Rhea. The square is Kronos. And the star shape is for
Medusa, the sorceress and the prophet.$
#00059
You may wonder why Medusa's symbol is the star-shaped
stone. To explain why, I must first tell you how the
galaxy of gods came to be.$
#00060
How to get to the Temple of Wisdom? The Sphinx in the
Temple of Beauty leads to the shrine in the Temple of
the Sun. That's the entrance.$
#00061
There are no sapphires here.$
#00062
You wish to see Lady Metis?$
#00063
Wouldn't it be quicker to ask Lucia or Bermuda?$
#00064
Sorry, I don't know anything about the windmill trick.$
#00065
Can I help you?$
#00066
Lord Triton, you must resemble your mother. I've heard
she is from Earth, but I feel like I've seen your face
somewhere.$
#00067
You've got the sword of Lady Metis, just as I expected
of Lord Poseidon's son. You are very different from
Bermuda.$
#00068
You must be wondering why it was hidden in a rock, but
that was the wish of Lady Metis.$
#00069
She didn't want anyone to touch it and turn to stone...
We mustn't tarry. Lord Triton, go to the Temple of
Beauty.$
#00070
Remember how the bridge rose out of the water? The
answer is on the same tablet.$
#00071
I know where the sword is. Did you see the tablet on
when you came back from Lady Metis? You can't see it
from here.$
#00072
Behind the bridge, there's a tablet that shows what to
do. If you are the saviour of the galaxy, a sword
should appear in this temple.$
#00073
Old Baba used to sped a lot of time in the Temple of the
Titans. I heard that Lady Metis held a lot of respect
for her.$
#00074
I see... So Lady Metis wasn't in a good mood after all.
She's been like that for a while now.$
#00075
Old Baba has known Metis for a long time, so I think
she may know the cause of this.$
#00076
Lady Metis is a very calm person. Try to not make too
much noise.$
#00077
I apologise for my rudeness earlier. I thought that
Medusa might have assumed Lord Triton's appearance...
Please forgive my impertinence.$
#00078
Lady Metis is waiting for you, please go ahead. You
may also take the golden apple. You will need it to
enter the Temple of Beauty.$
#00079
However, Lady Metis is in a bad mood right now. I
cannot guarantee that she will see you.$
#00080
If you are not Medusa, then you should be able to cross
the moat without using magic. Think on your feet and
use your head.$
#00081
I am Emeralia, priestess of Lady Metis, goddess of the
Titans. Who are you? Even if you are Lord Triton, I
cannot let you pass.$
#00082
How can you prove that you are not Medusa? Medusa could
have easily disguised herself as Lord Triton.$
#00083
I will not let you anywhere near Lady Metis.$
